2. Gradient Descent - THE MATH YOU SHOULD KNOW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p1ldISb90Q

Book/ more scientific papers and reads:
1. Great (no, amazing) book on convex optimization (read chapter 1 - Introduction on a broad overview of Optimization not limited to Gradient Descent): https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf 
A few notes on this book: Every applied math/computer scientist grad student should have read this book (or at least large parts of it). (Convex) Optimization is such an important field which you'll find every where. Obviously, we can't teach it in this class, but I recommend you this book a lot!
2. An overview of gradient descent optimizationalgorithms (quite scientific but gives comprehensive overview): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf
